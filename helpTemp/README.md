I used the Miwok app as a baseline (list_item_original). I am trying to have a floating bar with the song controls (play, back, forward) and a mini menu. See screenshot at 3.27.29
However I keep getting a repeating series of song controls and mini menu instead of floating bar.  See screenshot at 3.27.39
How should I modify the list_itemproposed so that I can get the intended result?
